SPGD: Search Party Gradient Descent algorithm, a Simple Gradient-Based Parallel Algorithm for Bound-Constrained Optimization

This is a preliminary code written for the SPGD paper.
The code is not effecient, and has lots of rooms for improvement.
We plan to release an updated version of this code in future.

The benchmark functions are listed out at the top of the jupyter notebook. Any one of the benchmark function can
be executed and then the functions of the SPGD algorithm can be executed to see how it performs.

By default 50 times SPGD is executed on the chosen benchmark functions, so that statistical results (like mean, best, worst) can be obtained.
