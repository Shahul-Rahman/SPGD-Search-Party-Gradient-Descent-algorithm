This is a preliminary code written for the SPGD paper.
The code is not efficient and has lots of room for improvement.
We plan to release an updated version of this code in the future.

The benchmark functions are listed out at the top of the jupyter notebook. Any one of the benchmark functions can
be executed, and then the functions of the SPGD algorithm can be executed to see how it performs.

By default 50 times SPGD is executed on the chosen benchmark functions, so that statistical results (like mean, best, worst) can be obtained.
